Results and code from my Bachelor Thesis, "How to map the graviational wave background of the universe: Identifying key technical challenges". Presented is a simple model for a solar gravitonal lens, and its effects on images, as well as a proof of concept AI collimator for correcting the resulting distortions. Please see file XXX & XXX for these results. All images produced are in the XXX directory. (finish this, clean up files and directories, comment code make more readable)
